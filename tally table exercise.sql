 Tally Tables Exercise

 The temporary table, #PatientAdmission, has values for dates between the 1st and 8th January 2026 inclusive
 But not all dates are present

AI prompt to help get started:

 Act as a SQL expert.   
 A table #PatientAdmission with columns AdmittedDate DATE (PK) and NumAdmissions INT  
 should have rows with contiguous dates from the earliest date (say 1 Jan 2026) 
 and the latest date (say 31 Dec 2026) 
 There should be no gaps. How do I list any gaps?
 I have a Tally table with column N with values between 1 and 10000.  Please use that in your response
