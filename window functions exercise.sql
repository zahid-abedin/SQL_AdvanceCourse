/*
COVID Cases Analysis
This uses Window functions to calculate cumulative totals and moving avarages, and to rank within groups

This uses a public dataset from https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/cases.
This has the number of cases reported each day for each of the four countries of the UK
I have renamed some column names from the original dataset to make them more clear.
